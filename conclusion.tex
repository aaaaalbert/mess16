\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

This work presents \sys, 
an Android app implementing a programmable 
sensor laboratory. \sys build on today's powerful, sensor-rich 
smartphone and tablet devices. Its sandbox execution environment is 
based on the Python scripting language and provides an easy-to-use 
programming platform for both local and distributed experimentation.

\sys is actively used in education and academia.
Its components are free, open-source software (FOSS)\footnote{\url{https://github.com/SensibilityTestbed}}. 
We invite you to freely extend and reuse them.
