\begin{abstract}
We present \sys\footnote{\url{https://sensibilitytestbed.com}}, 
a programmable sensor laboratory that runs on Android 
devices such as smartphones and tablets. \sys leverages the computational 
power and sensor facilities on these prevalent devices, and provides an 
easy-to-use, high-level programmable sandbox to enable experimentation 
and prototyping of sensor-enabled code.
\sys is an active project used by students, educators and researchers 
all around the world to experiment with sensor-enabled systems and 
advance the state of the art in sensor algorithms.
% All components of \sys are free and open-source software (FOSS).
